              Various address types can be used. Valid examples:
              `my-camera.my-site.com/feed`,
              `http://test:test@my-camera.my-site.com:80/feed?show=1`,
              `rtsp://site.domain.com/camera1`, `132.45.32.21`. As you can see
              from examples `address` can optionally contain information about
              `port`, `username` and `password`. In such cases these fields can
              be omitted from request body. The `arrow_service` field must not
              be present if the `address` field is being used.

              arrow_client:

              Use this field for stream detection via an Arrow client. The
              `path` field can be used to request detection on a specific
              endpoint in addition to all endpoints tested by the stream
              detector service. The `address` field must not be present if the
              `arrow_service` field is being used.

            type: string

          port:
            type: integer
            minimum: 1
            maximum: 65535
            description: If port is not specified all reasonable ports will be tested.
