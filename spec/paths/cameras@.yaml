              How is the camera connected to Angelcam. The `direct` connection
              means that the camera stream is available on a public IP address.
              The `arrow` option can be used for connecting cameras that can be
              accessed via an Arrow client. Please note that cameras connected
              via an Arrow client use URL in a specific format. You will need to
              use the [stream detection](#tag/camera-stream-detection) endpoints
              to obtain the URL first.

              Complete URL of a camera stream. H.264 cameras must use "rtsp"
              scheme, for MJPEG cameras it's allowed to use "http" and "https"
              schemes. The "https" scheme is valid only for cameras using the
              `direct` connection type.
        example:
          name: My brand new shiny camera
          type: h264
          connection_type: direct
          url: 'rtsp://username:password@175.36.248.73:554/live.sdp'
