    # Angelcam API


    > If you have any questions please feel free to contact our API team via
    email at

    > support@angelcam.com.


    Welcome! This document will help guide you through how to use Angelcam’s
    RESTful API. You’ll find that the

    RESTful API is not difficult to use, but does require some understanding of
    certain concepts behind

    Angelcam service.


    To begin, you MUST contact Angelcam support before using the API to request
    both a client ID and secret, for

    authorization, and an authorization grant type.


    ## Quick-start Guide


    > This example assumes you will use the API to access cameras under your
    Angelcam account. If your service

    > needs to access someone else's camera you will need to use more
    complicated

    > [Authorization code grant type](authentication).


    ### Obtain the access token


    You will need the client ID as well as the username and password of your
    Angelcam account. E.g. if your

    client ID is `DBaJcGbAT2Tbvbrz0fLh1uRmYURprJAQPxwFsgoo` and your Angelcam
    account is ` user@example.com` with

    password `mypassword` (this is the password you use to login to My Angelcam
    site; if you were given

    client secret by Angelcam support, you don't need it at the moment) the
    request would be

        $ curl -X POST https://my.angelcam.com/oauth/token/ -d "client_id=DBaJcGbAT2Tbvbrz0fLh1uRmYURprJAQPxwFsgoo&grant_type=password&username=user%40example.com&password=mypassword"

    The API response should look like

        {"refresh_token": "aFBNWhoLnq7hSTEVII5ELd9g20NjxC", "scope": "read write", "access_token": "1CP9xR6tqpRHzaZxWcFAp3GtkFcXEQ", "expires_in": 36000, "token_type": "Bearer"}

    ### Verify the authorization worked

        $ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 1CP9xR6tqpRHzaZxWcFAp3GtkFcXEQ" -X GET "https://api.angelcam.com/v1/me/"

    You should see information about your account

        {"id":1234,"email":"user@example.com","first_name":"Keyshawn","last_name":"Jacobs","phone":"+1608494652"}

    ### Use the access token to access the API endpoints

        $ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 1CP9xR6tqpRHzaZxWcFAp3GtkFcXEQ" -X GET "https://api.angelcam.com/v1/cameras/?limit=5"

    See the reference section for available resources and corresponding
    endpoints.


    ## Nuts and bolts


    ### Plain JSON


    The RESTful API runs over HTTP/1.1 and communicates using plain
    `application/json`.


    ### Trailing /


    Lastly, please keep in mind that all endpoint URLs require a trailing slash
    (`/`). For example,

    `cameras/282929/recording`, will result in a "404 Not Found". The correct
    URL in this case, with a trailing slash, is

    `cameras/282929/recording/`.


    ### Caching


    The API doesn't include any additional caching features, besides what is
    implied by the protocol layer.


    ### Rate limiting

    Some endpoints have rate limiting in place to protect our service from
    excessive amounts of requests. If you reach the limit, the server will
    respond with HTTP 429 and the `Retry-After` HTTP header will be set to the
    number of seconds that your client needs to wait before retrying the
    request.

    ### Resource Embedding and Field Fetching


    This API doesn't support the embedding of related resources, nor
    client-driven field fetching.


    ## Pagination


    Some endpoints, like `cameras/`, employ pagination with the use of the
    `limit` and `offset` parameters. Each paginated

    endpoint response has these fields:


    - `count` - total number of items

    - `next` - is link to next page of paginated result, can be null if reached
    end of set

    - `previous` - is link to previous set of paginated result, can be null if
    `offset` is 0

    - `results` - current paginated set


    We recommend you always explicitly set the `limit` parameter to ensure you
    know how many results, per page, you'll get.

    If you omit `limit`, the page will contain 100 items, at most.


    ### Setting the limit parameter


    Let’s say you need to request all the cameras of the user, but only want 5
    results at a time. Your `GET` would look

    something like this:

        $ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer " -X GET "https://api.angelcam.com/v1/cameras/?limit=5"

    Note the `limit` parameter in this call is set to 5, so the response shows
    items 0 through 4.


    ### GET the next page of results


    Next, let’s say you want to make a call to return the next page from the
    previous example. As you’ll see below, the

    `offset` parameter in the following sample link is 5, so the next page of
    results will show items 5 through 9:

        $ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer " -X GET "https://api.angelcam.com/v1/cameras/?limit=5&offset=5"

    ### How do I know if there are more pages?


    When the response contain null value of `next`, you know that you've reached
    the end.


    ## Time and duration formats


    ### Time and date formats


    Whenever you need to specify or have the API send you a date and time, it
    will be in the ISO 8601

    _YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ_ format (i.e. 2016-03-19T13:15:32Z) where:


    * YYYY is the year (i.e. 2016), MM is the month (i.e. 03), and DD is the day
    of the month (i.e. 19)

    * T is the delimiter between the date and time

    * HH is the hour, in 24-hour format (i.e. 1PM is 13), MM is the minute (i.e.
    15), and SS is the seconds (i.e. 32)

    * Z indicates the UTC (GMT 0) timezone


    All times from the API have both a date and time. You must pass a time part
    in all inputs, even if it's 00:00:00.


    All times from the API are in UTC. Similarly, all time inputs are expected
    in a UTC timezone.


    ### Duration format


    Some parts of the API, like the retention field in `cameras/{camera_id}/`
    and `cameras/`, use duration to denote a

    span of time (i.e. "30 days" or "2 months"). We use the standard ISO 8601
    duration format which uses the

    _P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S_ format. Here are a few examples of various
    durations:


    * PT30S - 30 seconds

    * PT2M - 2 minutes

    * P30D - 30 days

    * P2M - 2 months

    * P2M10D - 2 months and 10 days

    * P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S - 3 years, 6 months, 4 days, 12 hours, 30 minutes, and 5
    seconds



    # Authentication


    All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will
    fail. Additionally, all request must be

    authenticated. Angelcam API uses two types of authentication first is based
    on personal access tokens and second one is OAuth2.


    Personal Access Token can be preferred authentication when you need to
    access only to your own account, otherwise OAuth2 needs to be used when you
    are creating an app for more angelcam users - so for example when you are
    building your own application based on angelcam platform.


    For OAuth2 we support two different authentication workflows (_grant types_
    in terms of OAuth):


    * You ask your users for their Angelcam usernames and passwords (_resource
    owner password-based_ in terms of OAuth)

    * You ask Angelcam and we authenticate your users, similar to how Google or
    Facebook works if you choose "Sign-in using
      Google/Facebook" (_authorization code_ in terms of OAuth)

    Both authentication types result in the same - you exchange
    username/password or authorization code by calling

    `/oauth/token/` endpoint for access token. All API calls must supply this
    access token with

    `Authorization: Bearer ` as header. For example, with cURL commandline tool,
    your request would

    contain something like this:

        $ curl -H "Authorization: Bearer " -X GET  "https://api.angelcam.com/v1/cameras/?limit=5"

    These access tokens also have a limited-time validity (usually 10 hours) and
    you’ll have to [ask for new access token

    using refresh
    token](#introduction/authentication/refreshing-access-token-with-refresh-token)
    when current access token

    expires.


    An authenticated user can use `me/` to ask for account details including
    email, first name, last name, etc.


    ### Refreshing access token with refresh token


    The granted access_token is valid for expires_in seconds only. By default,
    it's set at 36000 seconds (10 hours) but you

    must always keep this value in mind and refresh the access token before it
    expires. A common practice of how to manage

    expiration is to refresh a token when you get a `401 Unauthorized` from any
    endpoint since all API endpoints must be

    authenticated.


    Example of unauthorized response:

        HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
        Date: Thu, 27 Apr 2017 10:41:58 GMT
        Content-Type: application/json
        WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="api"

        {"status":401,"title":"not_authenticated","detail":"Authentication credentials were not provided."}

    A new `access_token` can be obtained using a `refresh_token` when the
    current one expires. A `refresh_token` has no

    expiration date but it can only be used once. A new `refresh_token` is
    issued when the client refreshes the

    `access_token`, which causes all previous tokens to become invalid.


    To refresh the `access_token`, send another `POST` request to `oauth/token/`
    endpoint with:


    * `refresh_token`,

    * `client_id`,

    * `grant_type` with `refresh_token` value

    * `username` and `password` aren't required this time


    The server will then generate a fresh `access_token` and a new
    `refresh_token`.


    A refresh token can be invalidated by the `oauth/token-revoke/` endpoint.
    This usually occurs when a user logs out of

    your app or is performed by the Angelcam support team, upon request by the
    user or due to security concerns. In any

    case, you will need to then ask the user to grant authorization to your app
    again.

    description: >

      With the cameras/ endpoint, you can obtain a paginated list of the current
      user's cameras. Alternatively, if you know a

      camera's ID you can get the same information using the
      cameras/{camera_id}/ endpoint. In both cases you get important

      camera information:


      * camera ID, name and type

      * snapshot (thumbnail of recent camera content)

      * status (online, offline, unknown, ...)

      * list of live stream URLs in various formats to watch


      ## Camera and stream types


      Angelcam platform supports cameras with video in one of two formats: H.264
      or MJPEG. While many cameras support

      both formats, you need to choose which one to use to connect you camera to
      Angelcam. This is indicated by property

      "type" of the camera resource.


      The video stream from the camera can be retrieved from Angelcam CDN. For
      MJPEG type cameras you obtain only

      a MJPEG live stream. For H.264 type cameras, you can choose from multiple
      stream:

       * MJPEG
       * HLS
       * fMP4

      Each format has different characteristics making it suitable for certain
      usecases.


      ### MJPEG


      [MJPEG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_JPEG) (or Motion JPEG) is a
      stream of images in JPEG format.

      It does not contain audio track and uses more bandwidth than H.264 format.
      On the other, you can easily

      embed it into HTML page using  tag and most modern browsers will just play
      it out of the box

      (please note that Internet Explorer does not support MJPEG). Playing MJPEG
      is resource eficient so it's

      the prefered format if you need to have display streams from more cameras
      on a single page. Another advantage

      is that you can specify the refresh rate of the stream (e.g. only one
      frame per 10 seconds) to save

      the bandwidth.


      ### HLS


      [HLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming) (or HTTP Live
      Streaming) is HTTP-based protocol

      designed by Apple and supported by majority of the video players and web
      browsers. It is the prefered format

      of video stream for most usecases. Angelcam CDN provides the video as it
      is generated by the camera so

      the properties such as bitrate or image quality can vary depending on the
      camera settings and the encoder

      implementation. Please note that playback of H.264 video is resource
      intensive and playing multiple

      streams at once can cause signicant load on the viewers system.


      ### fMP4 (experimental)


      [fMP4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-23#section-3.3)
      (or Fragmented MP4)

      is video format provided by Angelcam CDN as an experimental feature for
      usecases requiring low latency

      between the live stream and real time. It does not contain audio track and
      can cause playback issues

      in some browser and camera combinations. Therefore we do not recommend
      using fMP4 in your application.


      ## Snapshot


      A snapshot is an affordable and quick way to give your users a sample of
      their on-going live stream, by periodically

      saving a picture of it. It's intended to give a preview of the camera's
      content without actually creating a connection

      to the live stream, which can be a resource-expensive operation.


      Please note, a snapshot may be up to 24 hours old but we'll auto initiate
      refreshing when you access camera endoints in

      API. If age is important to you, check the created_at field in the
      snapshots array returned by the

      `cameras/{camera_id}/` and `cameras/` endpoints.


      In cases where a more recent image is required, you can use a live
      snapshot or a MJPEG stream with a low frame rate

      instead.


      ## Live snapshot

      The live snapshot is a static picture of what the camera is currently
      shooting at the moment. This actually creates

      a connection to the camera and extracts the last keyframe from the camera
      stream.


      ## Live stream from camera


      The live stream is what the camera is currently shooting at the moment.
      For H.264 type cameras, you can choose from

      URLs in multiple live stream formats:

       * HLS
       * fMP4
       * MJPEG

      For MJPEG type cameras you can output only a MJPEG live stream.


      The live stream is intended for private live video monitoring just to the
      camera owner only. If you want to broadcast a video to public audience,
      please use our [broadcasting
      service](https://www.angelcam.com/apps/camera-broadcasting).


      ## Camera applications


      Connecting a camera and being able to get a snapshot or watch a live
      stream is offered to every Angelcam user, but to

      get the most out of a camera, users usually add some apps. Among other
      information, the cameras/{camera_id}/ and

      cameras/ endpoints will tell you apps added to a user's camera as a list
      of app codes.


      We currently support these applications in this API with the following
      codes (uppercase):


      * LSA - Broadcasting

      * CRA - Cloud Recording

      * VVA - Video Verification

      * VPA - Video Guard


      The applications added to a camera depend on the user's country as some of
      them are not available in every country.

      email informing them that you share camera with them. In case when there
      was no account with given email we precreate an account for these guest.

      ![Recording sequence diagram](./assets/recording_sequence.png)


      The Cloud Recording application (CRA) safely stores any content captured
      by your camera to the cloud. If a camera

      doesn't have the CRA application, all camera recording endpoints will
      return 404. Otherwise, you can start by asking general

      recording information using the `cameras/{camera_id}/recording/` endpoint.


      Most notably, this endpoint tells you whether the camera is currently
      recording or not (i.e. recording might not have

      been started by the user yet, there’s an error, etc.). As with all
      "active" operations, the user must use our web

      application to start a recording.


      Another piece of information reported by this endpoint is the retention
      period, which dictates how long a video will be

      stored. This is particularly useful for obtaining a
      `cameras/{camera_id}/recording/timeline/`.


      ## Timeline and segments


      It's important to note that in the Angelcam API there are some terms that
      sound similar but have different meanings:


      * _record_ (noun) - a continuous block of video content, as stored by the
      recording. To clearly distinguish it from a
        “recording” we called it a _record segment_ or simply, _segment_.
      * _recording_ (verb) - the process of capturing a record, or records,
      which are then stored.


      Timeline listening at the `cameras/{camera_id}/recording/timeline/`
      endpoint is a collection of record segments for a

      given camera and time interval. In  order to save bandwidth and resources,
      the maximum length of timeline you can

      request, per single call, is 24 hours.


      If a recording was running uninterrupted, within a specified start and end
      time, the result will contain one segment.

      Often "missing" slots will appear on the timeline, usually because the
      user may have manually stopped the recording or

      there were some camera errors.


      ## Recording stream


      If you know which video segment(s) from the timeline you want to play,
      calling `cameras/{camera_id}/recording/stream/`

      will create a stream from that specified segment(s) and tells you its URL
      and format.


      Using `start` and `end` query parameters, you can specify a beginning and
      ending time of the stream. You can even omit

      the `end` parameter and the stream will play until the very end of the
      recorded footage or, if the camera is currently

      recording, the stream will continue uninterrupted.


      Among other things, the endpoint tells you the URL of
      `recording/stream/{streamer_name}/{stream_id}/` with the stream's

      additional details.


      ## Syncing stream and timeline


      Due to various reasons, the time a user spends watching a stream doesn't
      necessarily have to match the time actually

      elapsed in the recorded video (i.e. a 5-minute long stream takes 6 minutes
      to watch on a user's slow mobile network

      connection due to lag).


      Periodically calling endpoint,
      `recording/stream/{streamer_name}/{stream_id}/`, comes in handy in this
      case, because it

      synchronizes the time shown to the user in your UI, with the current time
      of the stream. This endpoint tells you the

      exact time where the stream is positioned at the current moment. You
      normally don't have to know the `streamer_name`

      and `streamer_id` path parameters, but use the generated endpoint URL as
      reported by `stream_info` field from

      `cameras/{camera_id}/recording/stream/`.

        - Pagination can be done only using link in `next` attribute that is part of response
        - Pagination is possible only in one direction (it is not possible to go to previous page)

      If you know a sensor's ID you can get the same information using the
      sensors/{sensor_id}/ endpoint, update sensor settings or delete sensor.


      Sensor can be bind to one particular already connected

        - 2 minutes
        - 5minutes

      After creation each sensor is given a unique sensor hash that can be used

      Endpoints for managing Arrow clients. Arrow client is an application that
      powers all Angelcam ready devices such as AngelBoxes, Angelcam ready
      cameras, etc. You can use these endpoints to pair Arrow clients with a
      specific user account, to get some useful information about the clients
      and the services they provide, and to give commands to the clients. Before
      you are allowed to access an Arrow client, you need to pair it with your
      user account.


      ## Pairing an Arrow client

      In order to pair an Arrow client with the current user account, you need
      to:

      1. Make sure that the Arrow client is in pairing mode. An Arrow client is
      in pairing mode only the first 20 minutes after it's started, so you
      probably need to restart the device with the Arrow client before you
      initiate the pairing process.

      2. Initiate the pairing process by sending a POST request to the
      [`arrow-clients/`](#operation/arrow-client-pairing-request) endpoint. The
      API will respond with Arrow client UUID.

      3. Wait until the Arrow client connects to the Angelcam cloud. You can use
      the returned UUID to poll the
      [`arrow-clients/{uuid}/`](#operation/arrow-client-detail) endpoint until
      the API responds with `online` status.
