Welcome! This document will help guide you through how to use Angelcam’s RESTful API. You’ll find that the
RESTful API is not difficult to use, but does require some understanding of certain concepts behind
Angelcam service.

To begin, you MUST contact Angelcam support before using the API to request both a client ID and secret, for
authorization, and an authorization grant type.
