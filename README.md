# Angelcam Developer docs

Sources for http://developers.angelcam.com, API and guides documentation, generated by [Dapperdox](http://dapperdox.io/) from Markdown (guides) and Swagger (API reference) files.

## Running

To run Dapperdox developer website from this image:

* choose host machine port - Dapperdox runs on 3123 and it's best to use the same on host
* map your Dapperdox sources to `/dapperdox/` in container
* choose container meaningful name like 'developer-docs`

In words of commandline e.g.:

    $ docker run --rm --name developer-docs -p 3123:3123 -v ~/git/developer-docs/dapperdox_src:/dapperdox angelcam/develop-docs
    
Then go to http://localhost:3123 in your web browser and enjoy!

## Configuration

Dapperdox running inside Docker container support configuration via environment variable only. Equivalent variable names to commandline options is found in [Dapperdox configuration guide](http://dapperdox.io/docs/configuration-guide).

By default specdir is set to `/dapperdox/specs` and assets to `/dapperdox/assets`. Because folders in `dapperdox_src/` have already these names you typically only map `/dapperdox/` to `dapperdox_src/`.

For example to change a specdir, set environment variable `SPEC_DIR` with `-e`:

    $ docker run --rm --name developer-docs -p 3123:3123 -v ~/git/developer-docs/dapperdox_src:dapperdox_src:/dapperdox -e SPEC_DIR /path/to/my/specdir angelcam/develop-docs

This script does build and publish under `angelcam/developer-docs`. You must be `docker login` to push as Docker Hub angelcam user.
